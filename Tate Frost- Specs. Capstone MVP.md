## <h1>Name: “Stalk Star”</h1>

### Pitch/Idea: 
* Create a web application that allows users to create an account and sign up to receive email notifications when any music artists they select to “follow” releases a new song or music video on their Youtube channel. 

### MVP: 
* Users can create a user account 
* Users can log in to their account 
* Users can select and deselect as many music artists as they would like to “follow” or “unfollow” 
* If logged in, users can sign out of their account 
* An email is received by the user any time an artists on their follow list releases a new song

### Future/Extra features:
* A more social media like feed and profile page, in which users can see news updates or online appearances of the stars they follow, and can also make posts in communities dedicated to artists or genres 
* A section where users may share playlists with one another, and can search/filter by popularity and genre
* The ability to receive emails with news updates or stories about their favorite stars as well
* Users can create a ‘listen list’ of artists they would like to try listening to in the future to see if they enjoy them 
* The ability to be notified when an artists is selling new items or merchandise 
* The ability to receive notifications by text message as well
